MMTDrop.Report

One report consits of:
  - a title
  - one or many filter(s)
  - one or many chart(s). 
    There are also a small icon bar representing the kinds of charts 
    if the charts have different kinds (pie, bar, table, ...)

To create a report, using new MMTDrop.Report(options) 
with options is an object taking the following form:

  - stats   : object, describes which data to get, eg, {period: [MINUTE / HOUR / DAY / WEEK / MONTH], probe:[], source:[], raw: true/false}
  - elemid  : string, is id of an HTML element to which to show report
  - title   : string, is title of report
  - elements: array,  is a configuration of a list of charts.
        Each element of the list is an object in form:
      |-- chart: array, is a configuration of a list of charts
      |   |-- type    : string, [timeline, xy, scatter, bar, pie, tree, table]
      |   |-- options : object,
      |     |-- getDataFct: callback(data, options, args), is called when rendering the chart to get data from @{stats}.
      |     |                   This function must return an array. Each element of the array is an object taking the following form:
      |     |                     -- name : string
      |     |                     -- y    :
      |     |                     -- data :
      |     |                     -- total:
      |     |                     -- type :
      |     |-- seriesName: string,
      |     |-- ylabel    :
      |     |-- colnames  : array,
      |     |-- click     : callback,
      |     |-- link      : array,
      |     |-- dblclick  :
      | -- pos  : array, eg, [x,y], is the left-top ??? position of the charts
  - filters : array,  is a configuration of a list of filters.
        Each element of filters is an object
      |-- type  : string,  is kind of filter: [appname, appclass, metric, period, probe]
      |-- label : string,  is label of the filter
      |-- select: callback(e), is called when the value of the filter has been changed
